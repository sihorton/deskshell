# deskshell
A portable desktop wrapper for webapps.



### Technical Note:

Internally this is the second release of the deskshell wrapper. This version does away with the platform runtime in preference for an entirely portable design. This design ends up being much more nodejs friendly but can still be used by developers that are not familiar with nodejs.
